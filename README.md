# PrototypeOne

A basic game developed in Unity, used as a learning experience and a prototype for future games.  

## About

PrototypeOne, developed in Unity, is a top-down wave based game. The game supports local multiplayer and PS4 controllers. The game challenges you to last as long as you can as the difficulty increases per wave. There are special waves, mini-bosses and bosses to add variety to the game. 

 Some of the 3D assets are taken from the [Unity Asset Store]([https://assetstore.unity.com/](https://assetstore.unity.com/)).


## Project Status

You can follow the progress of the game on here on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/KYWTQTZe/prototype-game-1). There are no set deadlines as this game is just a learning experience and a prototype for future games.  

## Getting Started
 
You will require [Unity]([https://store.unity.com/](https://store.unity.com/)) to be able to modify the game. After installing Unity, download this repository and load it into Unity. 

There are currently 3 scenes in the game.

 - MainMenu scene `Allows selection of characters and loads WaveTest scene` 
 - WaveTest scene `A vertical slice of the game, used for testing waves and gameplay`
 - TestLevel scene `A scene purely for testing`

## Demo

A demo will be posted after the game reaches the ability to be a standalone game with a properly developed map.

Photos and videos will be posted at a later date.
